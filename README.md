# trending-api-64

in progress

When i was writing messages for commits i hadnt yet thought that all the files would be captioned as "..with unsolved bugs" etc. 
The real case is it is alive and kicking and bugs are rare

now it has something going on with the search by name, but i dont yet know why is that, it may even be the trouble on Github API side. To be hones -- i got no clue yet.
